 According to Assignment3_task_a excel file which contained the data and plots, the following text will explain the
 observation of 3 scenarios and compare the result referring to the fundamental diagram of traffic flow theory. The grid
 1 row and 50 column is used.
 (Speed unit: grids moved/time step, Density unit: number of cars/grid, Outflow unit: number of cars reach end/time step)

1. Free flow Scenario:
    The overall average Mean Speed is 1.447 which is the highest among all scenario, Density is 0.1684 which is the lowest,
    Outflow is 0.27.
    The relation between Mean Speed and Density is that the higher the Density the lower the Mean Speed.
    Most of the Mean Speed are range form 1 to 2, and Density are from 0.1 to 0.25. Overall, this plots correspond to
    the fundamental diagram.
    The relation between Mean Speed and Outflow is that there is no obvious tendency, however, the maximum Outflow
    is 0.6 with corresponding to Mean Speed from 1 to 1.5, and the minimum Outflow 0 correspond to Mean Speed from
    2 to 0.5. Overall, this plots is not really correspond to the fundamental diagram.
    The relation between Outflow and Density is discrete, with most Density range from 0.1 to 0.25 and Outflow range
    from 0.2 to 0.4. Overall, this plots is not really correspond to the fundamental diagram.

2. Platooning Scenario:
    The overall average Mean Speed is 1.404, Density is 0.1712, Outflow is 0.28 which is the highest.
    The relation between Mean Speed and Density is that the higher the Density the lower the Mean Speed. Most of the
    Mean Speed are range form 1 to 2, and Density are from 0.1 to 0.25. However, the plots is more concentrated than
    Free flow Scenario. Overall, this plots correspond to the fundamental diagram.
    The relation between Mean Speed and Outflow is that there is no obvious tendency, however, the maximum Outflow
    is 0.8 with corresponding to Mean Speed from 1 to 1.5 and 3 that might be outlier, and the minimum Outflow 0
    correspond to Mean Speed from 2 to 0.5. Overall, this plots is more concentrated to Outflow 0.2 to 0.4 than
    Free flow Scenario, but still not really correspond to the fundamental diagram.
    The relation between Outflow and Density is discrete, with most Density range from 0.1 to 0.25 and Outflow range
    from 0.2 to 0.4. Overall, this plots is more concentrated to Outflow 0.2 to 0.4 than Free flow Scenario, and it has
    profile of the fundamental diagram.

3. Congested flow Scenario:
    The overall average Mean Speed is 1.249 which is the lowest, Density is 0.1788 which is the highest, Outflow is 0.25
    which is the lowest, therefore it reasonably describe the phenomenon of the congested flow.
    The relation between Mean Speed and Density is that the higher the Density the lower the Mean Speed. Most of the
    Mean Speed are range form 0.5 to 2, and Density are from 0.1 to 0.25. However, the plots is more concentrated at
    Density range from 0.1 to 0.2 comparing to both previous scenarios. Overall, this plots correspond to the fundamental
    diagram.
    The relation between Mean Speed and Outflow is that there is no obvious tendency, however, the maximum Outflow
    is 0.6 with corresponding to Mean Speed from 2 to 0.5, and the minimum Outflow 0 correspond to Mean Speed from
    2 to 0.5. Overall, this plots is more discrete than both previous scenarios, but still not really correspond to
    the fundamental diagram.
    The relation between Outflow and Density is more concentrated than both previous scenarios, with most Density range
    from 0.1 to 0.2 and Outflow range from 0.2 to 0.4. Overall, this plots is correspond to the fundamental diagram.
