Task B

In free flow scenario 1000 simulation steps, if the probabilities of dawdle increase from 0.3 to 0.6, average Mean Speed
and Outflow decrease, and Density increase  which mean causing more chance of occurring congestion and long kinematic waves.
If the probabilities of emitting Cars increase from 0.5 to 0.8, the Density slightly increase, and Mean Speed and
Outflow increase. Overall, it is approaching the critical outflow of this road.
If the dawdle speed decrease from 1-2 to 2-3, average Mean Speed and Outflow decrease, and Density increase that increase
the chance of the congestion and long kinematic waves.

The Nagel-Schreckenberg model is a cellular automaton model for road traffic flow of freeway traffic, the unit of road
length is a cell and unit of time is an time step. The action pattern of this model is Accelerate, Brake(slow down),
Randomization (speed at least 1 will decrease in certain probabilities), and Movement. It indicates the occurrence of
congestion internally without ant disturbance externally, and it is able to observe the interaction between cars on the
road during congestion. (Nagel, K. & Schreckenberg, M.,1992)

The Nagel-Schreckenberg model can be related to this work with its characteristic of Randomization that can represent
driver behavior such as dawdling, if there is no Randomization then all driver pattern will be the same. Moreover, we
are able to adjust Randomization and other indicator to simulate different traffic scenarios to measure or forecast the
emerging congestion and the speed of kinematic waves.
